This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces 
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements 
-->
<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <summary>Full C++ implementation of I2P client</summary>
    <description>i2pd

[Русская версия](https://github.com/PurpleI2P/i2pd_docs_ru/blob/master/README.md)

i2pd (I2P Daemon) is a full-featured C++ implementation of I2P client.

I2P (Invisible Internet Protocol) is a universal anonymous network layer. 
All communications over I2P are anonymous and end-to-end encrypted, participants
don't reveal their real IP addresses. 

I2P client is a software used for building and using anonymous I2P 
networks. Such networks are commonly used for anonymous peer-to-peer 
applications (filesharing, cryptocurrencies) and anonymous client-server 
applications (websites, instant messengers, chat-servers).

I2P allows people from all around the world to communicate and share information
without restrictions.
