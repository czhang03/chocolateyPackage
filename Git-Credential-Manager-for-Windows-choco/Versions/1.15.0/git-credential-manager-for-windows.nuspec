This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces 
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->

    <summary>Secure Git credential storage for Windows.</summary>
    <description># Git Credential Manager for Windows [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/jl6oe1thiwv5s52o/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/whoisj/git-credential-manager-for-windows/branch/master)

The [Git Credential Manager for Windows](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows) (GCM) provides secure Git credential storage for Windows. It's the successor to the [Windows Credential Store for Git](https://gitcredentialstore.codeplex.com/) (git-credential-winstore), which is no longer maintained. Compared to Git's built-in credential storage for Windows ([wincred](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Credential-Storage)), which provides single-factor authentication support working on any HTTP enabled Git repository, GCM provides multi-factor authentication support for [Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/), Team Foundation Server, and GitHub.

This project includes:

* Secure password storage in the Windows Credential Store
* Multi-factor authentication support for Visual Studio Team Services
* Two-factor authentication support for GitHub
* Personal Access Token generation and usage support for Visual Studio Team Services and GitHub
* Non-interactive mode support for Visual Studio Team Services backed by Azure Directory
* Kerberos authentication for Team Foundation Server 
* Optional settings for Docs/Automation.md

## How to use

You don't. It [magically](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/issues/31) works when credentials are needed. For example, when pushing to [Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com), it automatically opens a window and initializes an oauth2 flow to get your token.

    <releaseNotes>[![Downloads](https://github-basic-badges.herokuapp.com/downloads/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/v1.15.0/total.svg)](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/releases/tag/v1.15.0)

In this release:
- Add support for multiple users per host by using the `https://{username}@{host}` repository URL format.
   - _Note:_ the GitHub Authentication class does not support this feature.
- Add support for user configured privilege scopes when requesting new VSTS personal access tokens.
- Add automatic VSTS tenant cache eviction when credentials are invalid.
   - Due to an abnormally large number of problems related to invalid tenant cache entries, entries will now be evicted  when their related credentials become invalid.
- Add verification step to VSTS credential deletion.
   - When Git requests that VSTS credentials be deleted from the cache, the VSTS Authentication class will attempt to verify the credentials before deleting them. Only credentials which are verified to be invalid will be deleted.
   - This is designed to avoid unnecessary credential removal caused by flaky networks and other interruptions which might cause Git to report the credentials are invalid.
- Improved support for handling HTTP proxies (thank you @MagooChris for your contributions).
- Improved the general, Bitbucket usage, and VSTS integration documentation.
- Add new `config` verb for dumping state affecting the GCM.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue which caused the GCM to fail when standard input was invalid (thanks to @ebugusey).
- Fixed an issue where the GCM's internal logging mechanism could fail causing the GCM to fail.
- Fixed an issue where the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable was incorrectly being ignored.

To install the Git Credential Manager, download and double-click the `GCMW-1.15.0.exe` installer. It is that easy, it will even install [Git for Windows 2.15.0)](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) and the [Microsoft .Net Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w0x726c2%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) for you if necessary.

For non-installation or custom installation needs, download the `gcmw-v1.15.0.zip` archive and expand its contents. Use the included `install.cmd` or options provided via `git-credential-manager install` to complete setup.
